This repository contains all problems that I have solved on the [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/).

The repository is structured as follows:
 * [Contests](https://github.com/SigCatta/CodeForces/tree/main/Contests) contains all problems solved during a contest
 * [EDU](https://github.com/SigCatta/CodeForces/tree/main/EDU) contains all solved problems contained in codeforce's EDU section
 * [Training](https://github.com/SigCatta/CodeForces/tree/main/Training) contains all problems solved as training
 * [scripts](https://github.com/SigCatta/CodeForces/tree/main/scripts) contains all the scripts that I use when solving problems

Each contest has its own directory names as Contest_{Contest ID number}.

Each commit message represnts the name of the constest.

All files use a [template](https://github.com/SigCatta/CodeForces/blob/main/template_cpp) which contains a few useful typedefs, defines and includes.
